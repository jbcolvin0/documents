- [Resume](<Jacob Colvin.pdf>)
- [Causal Inference Do Calculus Example](causal_inference_do_calculus_example.pdf)
    - Uses the causal graph (or DAG) from figure 3.8 (f) from "Causality" by Judea Pearl, 2nd edition.
    - This includes essentially a cheat sheet for "Do Calculus" with a worked-out example with an excessive amount of work shown documenting each step.
    - The purpose was to verify if your causal graph sticks with normal distributions and linear transformations (i.e. can use linear regression models).  Will the resulting causal model remain analytically tractable with no monte carlo simulation required?
